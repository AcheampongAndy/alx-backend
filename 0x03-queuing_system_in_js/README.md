# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Description
This project involves building a queuing system using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Redis**, with the Kue library for job queuing. The goal is to develop a robust and efficient queuing system while learning how to work with Redis and handle asynchronous operations.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn:
- How to run a Redis server on your machine.
- How to perform simple operations using the Redis client.
- How to integrate a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
- How to store and manage hash values in Redis.
- How to handle asynchronous operations with Redis.
- How to use Kue as a queuing system.
- How to build a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server.
- How to build an Express application that integrates Redis with a queue system.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 18.04, Node.js 12.x, Redis 5.0.7.
- **File Format**: All files should use the `.js` extension and end with a newline.
- **Documentation**: A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project directory.
