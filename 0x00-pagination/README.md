# Pagination Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the implementation of pagination in a back-end REST API. It includes techniques for managing large datasets in a scalable and deletion-resilient manner. The dataset used for this project is based on popular baby names in the United States, available in the file `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`.

### Project Timeline
- **Start Date**: October 24, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Deadline**: October 29, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: October 25, 2024, 12:00 PM

### Key Concepts
In this project, youâ€™ll learn how to:
1. **Paginate a dataset** using page and page size parameters.
2. Implement **hypermedia metadata** to provide contextual information in paginated data.
3. Create a **deletion-resilient pagination system** that maintains pagination structure even when data entries are removed.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the fundamentals of pagination and the role of `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- Describe how hypermedia metadata enhances pagination.
- Implement deletion-resilient pagination, ensuring stable results even if some records are removed from the dataset.
