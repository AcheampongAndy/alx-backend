# 0x02. i18n Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on internationalization (i18n) using Flask and Flask-Babel. It includes the localization of templates, language switching based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers, and the localization of timestamps.

The primary goal of this project is to learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages, and to correctly infer the locale for a user based on various factors such as URL parameters or request headers.

## Learning Objectives
- Parametrize Flask templates to display content in different languages.
- Infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- Localize timestamps and format them correctly based on the user's locale.

## Requirements
- The project must be interpreted/compiled using Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- All Python files must end with a new line.
- All Python files must have executable permissions.
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide with `pycodestyle` version 2.5.
- Each Python file should start with the line `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All modules, classes, functions, and methods should have documentation (docstrings).
